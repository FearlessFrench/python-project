# Python Project
### About
Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected, making it flexible and easy to use. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library. This extensive library supports various tasks, from web development to data analysis and scientific computing.

Python's syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward, using significant indentation to define code blocks instead of curly braces or keywords. This feature makes Python code visually uncluttered and easy to understand.
