# Python Project
### About
This project is designed to provide a fast-paced, in-depth, and practical review of the most essential Python concepts. Whether you're a complete beginner preparing for an interview or an intermediate developer needing a quick refresher, this resource condenses a wealth of knowledge into a focused, 12-hour learning path.

The goal is not just to read about code, but to write it. The repository contains a series of files, each representing a segment of the review. The content is structured to build upon previous lessons, ensuring a solid foundation in core programming principles and practical Python syntax.
